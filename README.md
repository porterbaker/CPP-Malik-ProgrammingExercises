# CPP-Malik-ProgrammingExercises - Jackson Baker
List of programming exercises coded by myself as I learn C++. All of these have a prompt included from the book itself. I'm hoping to learn C++ as my main programming language. I learned some of it using this textbook from my junior college, Blinn College in Bryan/College Station, and I loved it. The University of Mississippi teaches us java, but I prefer C++ over it.
